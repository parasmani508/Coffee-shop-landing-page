I developed a responsive landing page for a coffee shop using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a modern design with interactive elements such as a menu carousel and contact form. Through careful use of CSS media queries, the page is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
